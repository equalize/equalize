### 👋 Hi

I'm Matthew (aka "equalize"). Husband, dad, programmer, internet traffic and load-balancing expert. My best and favoriate language is Golang. I love gummy bears, podcasts, cooking, fall weather, video games, being outdoors *and* being indoors. 

Some of my favorite things on the internet right now are:
- 🐸 [Bufo Offers Bufo] (https://bufo.zone/)
- 🦕 [ADHD Dinos](https://adhdinos.com)
- 🍳 [Emoji Kitchen](https://emojikitchen.dev)
- 🎹 [Ronald Jenkees](https://ronaldjenkees.bandcamp.com)
- 🎵 [LoFi Girl](https://www.youtube.com/@LofiGirl)
- 🎏 [CGP Grey](https://cgpgrey.substack.com/p/does-your-flag-fail)
- 🕹️ [Let's Game It Out](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q)

### 🏗️ I'm currently working on

Reliability at [Temporal](https://github.com/temporalio)!

### 🌱 I’m currently learning

Hobbyist game development as a way to teach my kids programming. We started with [Apple Playgrounds](https://developer.apple.com/swift-playgrounds/) and are doing some basic things in pure XCode now with Swift and [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/). But we're looking to make the jump over to learning [GoDot](https://godotengine.org).
